libcoin supports building of static and dynamic libraries on:
* Linux
* Mac OS X
* Windows
Further, the reference application, bitcoind, is supported along with a number of representative examples.

To build libcoin on unix flavor systems, you need to install development versions of Berkeley DB, Boost and OpenSSL. (Please note that on some systems OpenSSL does not contain ECDSA, if so, please install it yourselves). After installation of the necessary dependencies building follows the standard ./configure, make, make install scheme.

```
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev libdb++-dev cmake
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

If you would like to tweak the installation, run the configure part manually by calling:

`cmake .` or `ccmake .`

with the preferred generator. E.g. on Mac OS X building with Xcode can be accomplished by:
```
cmake -GXcode .
```

Then open libcore.xcodeproj using Xcode and build libcoin from here.

On windows separate building instructions can be found online:
